# **Labyrinth of Algorithms**
Labyrinth of Algorithms is a web application that provides a visual representation of popular search algorithms navigating through user-customized mazes. This project was developed as part of a Software Engineering course at Case Western Reserve University alongside student github.com/Lukas-Liven. Included in this project are the necessary files to run the application as well as design documents created to bolster our understanding of the project development process.

## **Features**
- Visualization of popular search algorithms: The application visualizes a few popular search algorithms including Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra's, and my personal favorite Random Walk.
- Customizable mazes: Users can create and customize their own mazes by drawing and deleting walls with their mouse inside a changeable grid size.
- Easy-to-understand visualizations: The visualization shows users how the varying algorithms search through mazes and the path of their final routes once the destination is reached.
- Interactive user interface: The application includes an interactive user interface built using React.js, CSS, and HTML, allowing for easy alterations to the maze configuration.
